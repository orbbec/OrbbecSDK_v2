# LiDAR User Guide

Orbbec SDK v2.6.2 and later supports LiDAR devices like the Pulsar ME450 and SL450. It allows easy discovery and management of LiDAR hardware, real-time point cloud capture, and synchronized IMU measurements. Key features include flexible device configuration, real-time streaming, and recording/playback tools, facilitating development, testing, and deployment in robotics, mapping, and automation.

## Sample
There are [several example](examples/LiDAR_README.md) programs designed to help users learn how to use LiDARs, including acquiring point cloud data and IMU data, as well as recording and playing back LiDAR data.
