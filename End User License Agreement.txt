End User License Agreement (SDK for Orbbec Hardware)

This End User License Agreement ("EULA") is a legal agreement between you (an individual or entity) and Orbbec Inc. or one of its affiliates (collectively,  "Orbbec", "we", "us" or "our") governing your access to and use of the Orbbec software development kit that includes an open-source library and a proprietary extension library (together, the "SDK"). 

By downloading, installing, accessing or using the SDK, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If you do not agree to these terms, you must not download, install, access, or use the SDK.

1. Definitions

In this EULA:

- "Open-Source Library" means the open-source components included with the SDK, which are licensed under the applicable open-source licenses accompanying those components. 

- "Extension Library" means Orbbec's proprietary software library included in the SDK that provides proprietary features and functionality and is licensed under this EULA. 

- "Orbbec Hardware" means genuine Orbbec-branded camera hardware lawfully obtained and used in accordance with Orbbec's terms and any applicable laws. 

- "You" and "Licensee" mean the individual or entity accepting this EULA and any of your permitted users.

2. License to the Extension Library

Subject to your continued compliance with this EULA, Orbbec grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable (except as expressly permitted under this EULA), royalty-free license to: 

- install and use the Extension Library solely for the purpose of developing, testing, integrating, and operating software or products that interface with or operate in conjunction with Orbbec Hardware; and 

- reproduce and redistribute the Extension Library only as incorporated in or bundled with your own software or products, provided that: the Extension Library is not distributed on a standalone basis, the Extension Library does not constitute the primary value of the distributed software or product; and such redistribution complies with Clause 5 (Distribution Requirements) and Clause 7 (Open-Source Components and Third-Party Software).

Use of the Extension Library is free of charge only for Licensees who own or use genuine Orbbec Hardware and only for so long as such use remains in conjunction with genuine Orbbec Hardware. 

If you do not own or use genuine Orbbec Hardware, you are not permitted to use the Extension Library without Orbbec's prior written consent and a separate license.

3. Open-Source Library

The Open-Source Library is licensed to you under the terms of the applicable open-source licenses accompanying those components. To the extent there is any conflict between this EULA and the applicable open-source licenses for the Open-Source Library, the open-source licenses shall govern your use of those components. 

Orbbec provides the Open-Source Library to you solely on the terms of those licenses and disclaims any additional rights not granted therein.

4. Restrictions (Extension Library Only)

Except with respect to the Open-Source Library, and except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law that cannot be overridden by contract, you must not, and must not permit any third party to: 

- reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or otherwise attempt to derive the source code, underlying ideas, algorithms or non-public APIs of the Extension Library; 

- modify, adapt, translate, create derivative works from, or alter the source files or object code of the Extension Library; 

- remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary notices or marks on or in the Extension Library; or 

- use the Extension Library in any manner that circumvents, disables, or interferes with its intended operation with Orbbec Hardware.

Nothing in this EULA limits rights you may have under mandatory laws in your jurisdiction that allow decompilation or interoperability, provided that any such rights are exercised only to the minimum extent permitted and after giving Orbbec prior written notice and a reasonable opportunity to provide the necessary information for interoperability on reasonable terms.

5. Distribution Requirements (Extension Library)

If you reproduce or redistribute the Extension Library as part of or bundled with your software or products:

- you are responsible for ensuring end users comply with terms no less protective than this EULA and for any acts or omissions of your distributors and end users; and
